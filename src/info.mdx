# Finite State Machine Game
The aim of this project is to offer users an interactive platform to explore 
finite state machines in a practical way. Through a graphical interface, users
can control a virtual robot by defining its states and transitions.   

The interactive graph on the left represents the robot's states as nodes and
the transitions between them as edges. Users can customize this graph by adding 
new nodes from the node picker, establishing new connections between nodes, 
or removing existing elements.  

The virtual environment on the right shows the movements of the robot alongside
visualisations of line detection sensors. Users can then use these events to
program transitions between different states of the robot, providing a 
hands-on experience in understanding finite state machines.

## Basic Usage
Note: Changes to the graph are lost when the page is closed.
<br/>
### Nodes and Edges
* Create new edges between nodes by dragging from the center of one node to another node.
* Delete edges by clicking on the line and pressing backspace.
* Create new nodes by drag and droping them from the Node Picker.
* Move nodes by dragging them by the outer ring.
* Delete nodes by clicking on the outer ring and pressing backspace.
* Copy paste nodes by clicking on the outer ring and pressing Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V.
* Select multiple nodes by pressing Shift and dragging.
<br/>
### Simulation
* Restart the simulation by refresing the page.
* Pause, resume, speed up, or slow down the simulation using the media buttons.  
<br/>
### Views
* Zoom the views using the scroll wheel.
* Pan the views by dragging.
* Resize the views by dragging the separator.
