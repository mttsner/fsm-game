# Finite State Machine Game
The aim of this project is to offer users an interactive platform to explore 
finite state machines in a practical way. Through a graphical interface, users
can control a virtual robot by defining its states and transitions.   

The interactive graph on the left represents the robot's states as nodes and
the transitions between them as edges. Users can customize this graph by adding 
new nodes from the node picker, establishing new connections between nodes, 
or removing existing elements.  

The virtual environment on the right shows the movements of the robot alongside
visualisations of line detection sensors. Users can then use these events to
program transitions between different states of the robot, providing a 
hands-on experience in understanding finite state machines.
